# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

I was motivated to complete this project to gain a larger understanding on how to make webpages from scratch, and practice my CSS skills more. I completed this to showcase my skills to whoever may be looking for my portfolio online.
I built this project to deliver the client the view of the employee's deployed portfolio with work samples.
Created a webpage from the ground up to deliver to the client.
I learned better CSS styling tactics and HTML outlining.

2. Open in VS code.
3. Right click the index.html and open it in your default browser.
4. You should now be able to view the page.
